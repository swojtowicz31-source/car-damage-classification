# Car Damage Classification with CNN

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify car damages into four categories:
- Back part of the car  
- Car windows  
- Front part of the car  
- Right/Left side of the car  

The models are developed and evaluated using TensorFlow/Keras on a custom dataset of vehicle images.

## Dataset

Due to size limitations, the dataset is **not included** in this repository.  
You should prepare or download your dataset organized in the following folder structure inside a `dataset/` directory:
Each subfolder should contain corresponding images for that class.

## Requirements

This project requires the following Python packages:

- TensorFlow  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- scikit-learn  

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
